Before running experiments, three directories need to be created here:- ```propositions/``` containing three files: propositions_{train, val, test}.json- ```representations/``` containing files {a, q}Bot_{RL_DIV, SL, ICCV_RL}_representations_{train, val, test}.h5- ```embeddings/``` containing files embeddings_{stsb-roberta-base-v2, stsb-bert-base, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, nli-roberta-base-v2}.pThe script copy_data.sh creates that structure.
