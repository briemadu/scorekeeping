# Python environmentsThis directory contains the YML files to recreate the conda environmentsused on each step:- ```environmentcoref.yml``` to run the coreference resolution model.- ```environment.yml``` to run the proposition generation.- ```main_task_environment.yml``` to run the main experiments with the probingclassifier.YML files ending in _installed were created using```conda env export --from-history > filename.yml````to help see which packages were installed directly. TXT files were created using ```pip3 freeze > filename.txt```because e.g. pandas does not appear on the conda environment.
